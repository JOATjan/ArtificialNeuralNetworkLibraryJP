## About the project

During summer I have spent some time writing a library capable of building, training and evaluating artificial neural networks in C#.
Thanks to my great patron, Bart≈Çomiej Hebda, a great, skilled developer I have managed to do so, and with good results. I've gained a quite good understanding of some machine learning mechanics.
When i thought about my own project, a clear way to go was writing same library again, but in a different language. I haven't written anything bigger in C++ before, and wanted to learn something new.
And here You can see the results.

If anyone wants to see the project files to compile the library, please contact me and I will gladly send You compressed project files.
