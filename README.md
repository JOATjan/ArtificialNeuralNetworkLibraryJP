## About the project

During summer I have spent some time writing a library capable of building, training, and evaluating artificial neural networks in C#.
Thanks to my great patron, Bart≈Çomiej Hebda, a great, skilled developer, I have managed to do so, and with good results. I've gained a quite good understanding of machine learning mechanisms inside neural networks.
When I thought about my own project, an obvious way to go was writing the same library again, but in a different language. I haven't written anything bigger in C++ before, and wanted to learn something new.
And here You can see the results.

If I did something wrong, any tips will be very appreciated.
If anyone wants to see the project files to compile the library, please contact me and I will gladly send You compressed project files.

## Future plans
- Adding input data dimensions check and error handling
- Adding more activation functions
- Optimizing backprop and ff algorithms

## Usage of the library

section in progress

## Example results
I have managed to get about 90% accuracy after 100 epochs training with 3 layers (sigmoid layers) in HIV protease cleavage dataset classification problem.
